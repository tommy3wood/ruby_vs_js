    // # Write a method that prints out every other number from 1 to 100. (That is, 1, 3, 5, 7 … 99).


    // # Write a method that accepts an array of numbers as a parameter, and counts how many 55’s there are in the array.


    // # Write a method that accepts an array of strings and returns a new array that has the string "awesomesauce" inserted between every string. 
    // # For example, if the initial array is ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"], then the returned array should be ["a", "awesomesauce", "b", "awesomesauce", "c", "awesomesauce", "d", "awesomesauce", "e"].


    // # Start with the hash: item_amounts = {chair: 5, table: 2}
    // # Someone just bought two chairs. Change the hash such that the chair amount is 3.
    // # The final result should be: {chair: 3, table: 2}


    // # Start with the hash: item_amounts = {chair: 5, table: 2}
    // # You received 7 desks to sell. Change the hash to include desks.
    // # The final result should be: {chair: 5, table: 2, desk: 7}


    // # Write a method that accepts a number and returns its factorial.
    // # For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.


    // # Write a method that accepts two arrays of numbers, and prints the sum of every combination of numbers from first and second array. 
    // # For example, if the method receives [1, 5, 10] and [100, 500, 1000], the method should print a list: 101, 501, 1001, 105, 505, 1005, 110, 510, 1010].
